        <h3>This is starting of css tutorial in index file</h3>
        <p>we are making the subscribe button like youtube so in first we write button and designed in css where colour means the text colour and border is none so it remove the border. px means the pixel. border radius is to make the curve side on the button. cursor means to change the pointer like hand. margin is used for space making as well as radius of border should be half of height for looking good.</p>
        <button class="subscribe-button">SUBSCRIBE</button>
        <button class="join-button">JOIN</button>
        <button class="tweet-button">Tweet</button>
        <p>now for hover effect or shadow. there are two hover and active which means hover is when our cursor or pointer points the button then it changes its colour and active means after clicking the button it changes its colour.it is also called pseudo classes where it is used to style an element when a user mouses over it.and for opacity it between 0 and 1 where it fade the elements. in box shadow there is four value 1st one is for horizontal 2nd value is for vertical 3rd value is for blur and 4th value for color  </p>
        <p>Basically the padding is used incase of width and height padding makes space inside the box.
        The browser are based on the text based so there is a feature vertical align which helps to make in same line
